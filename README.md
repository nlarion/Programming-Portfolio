#Welcome to Neil's Programming Portfolio
###This is project is meant to showcase the different software projects in my portfolio. 

Most of these projects were developed during my time at the Epicodus coding bootcamp. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing. Had a lot of fun building this page out. Feel free to take a look at the code, but the site is my main page on github.io here:
