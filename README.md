#Programming Portfolio

####Software Portfolio page for github projects.
####By: Neil Larion

## Description

###This is project showcases the different software projects in my portfolio. 

Most of these projects were developed during my time at the Epicodus coding bootcamp. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing. Had a lot of fun building this page out. Feel free to take a look at the code, but the site is my main page on github.io here:
##http://nlarion.github.io/

## Setup/Installation Requirements
Clone this repository.
Open index.html.
You should not need a HTML server to run this project, and should be able to run directly off your local file system by opening the index.html file with a web browser. 
I recomend chrome or chromium to run the site.
